S1: (Factually Consistent) To calculate the duration between two dates, we can subtract the first aired date from the last aired date, which will give us the number of days.
S2: (Factually Consistent) Here are the steps to calculate the duration and find the shortest season:

1. Convert the ""First aired"" and ""Last aired"" dates to a standard date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
S3: (Factually Consistent) 2. Calculate the duration in days for each season by subtracting the ""First aired"" date from the ""Last aired"" date.

S5: (Factually Consistent) The shortest season of Ismol Family in terms of the duration between the first and last aired episodes happened in season 2, with a duration of approximately four years.
S6: (Factually Consistent) To make calculations easier, let's convert them to a standard date format (YYYY-MM-DD):

Season 1:
First aired: 2014-06-22
Last aired: 2015-06-28

Season 2:
First aired: 2015-07-05
Last aired: 2016-01-03

Last aired: 2016-08-28

Season 4:
First aired: 2016-09-04
Last aired: 2016-11-06


Now let's calculate the duration for each season:

Season 1:
Last aired - First aired = 2015-06-28 - 2014-06-22 = 371 days

Season 2:
Last aired - First aired = 2016-01-03 - 2015-07-05 = 182 days

Season 3:
Last aired - First aired = 2016-08-28 - 2016-01-10 = 231 days

Season 4:
Last aired - First aired = 2016-11-06 - 2016-09-04 = 63 days

S4: (Factually Inconsistent) The total value of transfer fees paid by Ipswich Town F. C.is £7m.
S5: (Factually Inconsistent) However, the table is entirely irrelevant to the question about Ipswich Town F. C.because it only contains transfer fees paid by Barcelona F. C.
S6: (Factually Inconsistent) Let's assume an average exchange rate of 1 GBP = 1.3 USD.
S7: (Factually Inconsistent) Ipswich Town F. C.received a combined £20 million in transfer fees from the listed sales.
S8: (Factually Consistent) Here are the steps to calculate the total value of transfer fees:

1. Convert all fees to USD:
   - £4.8m = £4.8m * 1.3 = $6.24m
   - £4.5m = £4.5m * 1.3 = $5.85m
   - £3.1m = £3.1m * 1.3 = $4.03m
   - £3m = £3m * 1.3 = $3.9m
   - £2.75m = £2.75m * 1.3 = $3.58m
   
2. Convert USD to GBP:
   - $6.24m = $6.24m / 1.3 = £4.8m
   - $5.85m = $5.85m / 1.3 = £4.5m
   - $4.03m = $4.03m / 1.3 = £3.1m
   - $3.9m = $3.9m / 1.3 = £3m
   - $3.58m = $3.58m / 1.3 = £2.75m

3. Sum up the converted fees:
   - £4.8m + £4.5m + £3.1m + £3m + £2.75m = £18.15m

Now, let's calculate the average salt rejection percentage by dividing the sum by the total number of carbon nanotubes:

Average salt rejection percentage = Sum / Total number of carbon nanotubes

Since there are 4 carbon nanotubes in the table, the average salt rejection percentage is:

Average salt rejection percentage = 353 / 4 = 88.25
