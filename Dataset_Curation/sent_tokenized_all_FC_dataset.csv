Conference championship	        50,350
Super Bowl VII	                90,182
```

Step 1: Identify the attendance values for each game:
```
80,010
50,350
90,182
```

Step 2: Convert the attendance values to numbers:
```
80010
50350
90182
```

Step 3: Add up all the attendance values to get the total attendance:
```
80010 + 50350 + 90182 = 220542
```

Step 4: Count the number of games in the postseason:
```
3 games
```

Step 5: Divide the total attendance by the number of games to find the average attendance:
```
220542 / 3 = 73514

5,England Marcus Stewart,£2.75m,England Huddersfield Town,1 February 2000,-","Here are the steps to calculate the total value of transfer fees:

1. Convert all fees to USD:
   - £4.8m = £4.8m * 1.3 = $6.24m
   - £4.5m = £4.5m * 1.3 = $5.85m
   - £3.1m = £3.1m * 1.3 = $4.03m
   - £3m = £3m * 1.3 = $3.9m
   - £2.75m = £2.75m * 1.3 = $3.58m
   
2. Convert USD to GBP:
   - $6.24m = $6.24m / 1.3 = £4.8m
   - $5.85m = $5.85m / 1.3 = £4.5m
   - $4.03m = $4.03m / 1.3 = £3.1m
   - $3.9m = $3.9m / 1.3 = £3m
   - $3.58m = $3.58m / 1.3 = £2.75m

3. Sum up the converted fees:
   - £4.8m + £4.5m + £3.1m + £3m + £2.75m = £18.15m

Salt rejection percentages: 100, 100, 95, 58

Next, let's calculate the sum of the salt rejection percentages:

Sum = 100 + 100 + 95 + 58 = 353

Now, let's calculate the average salt rejection percentage by dividing the sum by the total number of carbon nanotubes:

Average salt rejection percentage = Sum / Total number of carbon nanotubes

Since there are 4 carbon nanotubes in the table, the average salt rejection percentage is:

Average salt rejection percentage = 353 / 4 = 88.25

Therefore, the average salt rejection percentage across all carbon nanotubes is approximately 88.25%.",2211
