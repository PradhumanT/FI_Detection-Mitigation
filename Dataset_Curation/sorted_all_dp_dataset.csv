5,England Marcus Stewart,£2.75m,England Huddersfield Town,1 February 2000,-","Here are the steps to calculate the total value of transfer fees:

1. Convert all fees to USD:
   - £4.8m = £4.8m * 1.3 = $6.24m
   - £4.5m = £4.5m * 1.3 = $5.85m
   - £3.1m = £3.1m * 1.3 = $4.03m
   - £3m = £3m * 1.3 = $3.9m
   - £2.75m = £2.75m * 1.3 = $3.58m
   
2. Convert USD to GBP:
   - $6.24m = $6.24m / 1.3 = £4.8m
   - $5.85m = $5.85m / 1.3 = £4.5m
   - $4.03m = $4.03m / 1.3 = £3.1m
   - $3.9m = $3.9m / 1.3 = £3m
   - $3.58m = $3.58m / 1.3 = £2.75m

3. Sum up the converted fees:
   - £4.8m + £4.5m + £3.1m + £3m + £2.75m = £18.15m

Therefore, the total value of transfer fees paid by Ipswich Town F. C.is £18.15m.",1072,FC
